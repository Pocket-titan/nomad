# **Missions**

- Neptune Odyssey (flagship)
  - Neptune-Triton orbiter and probe
- Triton Ocean World Surveyor (New Frontiers)
- Trident
  - Flyby only of both Neptune and Triton

## Neptune Odyssey

### **Key challenges**

- Availability of SLS Block 2 with Centaur upper stage
- NGRTG performance at required power output for mission
- HEEET TPS performance at mission peak pressure and heat flux
- Probe power growth and lifetime of primary batteries with long storage
- Complexity of large suite of instruments on an orbiter an a probe

### **Technical risk rating**

_Medium_: Medium new development, adequate to optimistic margins, and/or medium risk of achieving major mission objectives as proposed

## Uranus orbiter and probe

### **Key challenges**

- Power margin sensitivity to mission trajectory/lifetime alternatives
- Flight system lifetime for 18.5-year mission
- Payload requirements growth leading to more complex mission

### **Technical risk rating**

_Medium-Low_: Moderate new development, adequate margins, and/ or moderate risk to achieve major mission objectives as proposed

# **2022 Decadal Survey results (for 2023 - 2032)**

- Flagship missions:
  1.  Uranus Orbiter and Probe highest priority
  2.  Enceladus Orbilander
- Uranus over Neptune: why?
  - Lower technical risk (Medium-Low vs. Medium)
  - Lower cost (2.824M project estimate, 4.164M TRACE estimate **vs.** 3.395M project estimate, 5.177M TRACE estimate)
  - Neptune Odyssey **depends on SLS block 2 with Centaur upper stage**

Uranus mission is favored because an end-to-end mission concept exists that can be implemented in the 2023–2032 decade on currently available launch vehicles. Neptune Odyssey does not have demonstrated viable trajectories for a launch within the decade covered by this survey on currently available launch vehicle configurations, and there is a potential need for modifications to existing fairings. In addition, there are uncertainties in power requirements and the possible need for solar electric propulsion to reach Neptune if neither the SLS nor a Jupiter gravity assist are available. The Uranus mission has flexible trajectory opportunities, with the ability to be initiated at times throughout the decade including a launch as early as 2031.

The Neptune-Triton flagship was ranked lower than the Uranus Orbiter and Probe primarily owing to the **lack of demonstrated viable trajectories to Neptune for a launch within the decade** covered by this survey on available launch vehicles, **uncertainties in heavy lift launch vehicle accommodation**, and the potential need for solar-electric propulsion to reach Neptune if neither the SLS nor a Jupiter gravity assist is available. The concept would benefit from a new mission study in which a Jupiter gravity assist is not assumed, and **existing launch vehicles and power systems** are utilized. Such a study will **likely require consideration of the technological feasibility of solar electric propulsion**, identification of any technology developments required, and prioritization of potential science descopes while retaining Flagship-level science.

0. The recommendation that Triton Ocean World Surveyor be delayed until NF-7 took into consideration launch trajectories, which benefit from a Jupiter gravity assist likely available in the NF-7 timeframe.

## _Takeaways_

- Launch on Falcon Heavy (expendable)

# Idea

Apply lessons learned from Decadal Survey (that led to Uranus pick over Neptune) to Triton Ocean World Surveyor concept, and make it more Neptune specific & mix with core NOMAD goals
-> Orbiter with probe
-> Either **Jupiter Gravity Assist** or ~~Solar Electric Propulsion~~. + Aerocapture!

- CANNOT do solar electric -> needs to be JGA
- CAN do chemical monoprop powered legs (constraint?)
- Low-thrust = solar electric
  Can we make it a Discovery class mission? OR: we go for ESA classes...
- Mixing high- and low-thrust arcs??

# Trajectory

(Neptune Odyssey)
The interplanetary trajectory delivers Odyssey from Earth parking orbit to a hyperbolic encounter with Neptune. In balancing competing goals that include time of flight, LV availability for the required C3, phasing of gravity assist bodies, and arrival v∞ at Neptune, three alternatives were evaluated: chemical/direct, chemical/direct with a JGA, and chemical with a SEP stage. Each alternative provides interplanetary trajectories capable of delivering the payload within a 17- year time of flight. However, the last two alternatives were not selected as the baseline. First, although SEP is feasible, it was not selected as the baseline to retire the risk of carrying two separate propulsion subsystems (chemical and SEP). In addition, SEP trajectories lead to higher arrival v∞ at Neptune that results in higher Δ-V necessary to capture into Neptune’s orbit. Second, although chemical trajectories that rely on a JGA can significantly increase delivered mass, these were not selected as the baseline because the required Earth/Jupiter phasing is not favorable between mid-2033 and late 2036, thus leading to a 3-year gap in launch opportunities. Instead, a purely chemical, direct-to-Neptune trajectory was selected. Launch opportunities that satisfy mass and time-of-flight requirements are available every year in the 2030–2040 decade, each with a period of 18 consecutive daily launch windows arriving to Neptune with v∞ of ~6.5 km/s. All opportunities can deliver a mass of ≥3400 kg after Neptune injection. The 2033 launch opportunity was selected as baseline because it delivers the worst mass performance across the decade. As such, feasibility for this opportunity demonstrates feasibility for the rest. To increase performance, the Δ-V required for interplanetary transfer is broken into two maneuvers: First is the trans-Neptunian injection (TNI), an 8.6 km/s maneuver executed on May 31, 2033, while in a 2000-km Earth parking orbit, that injects the flight system into a highly eccentric (e = 0.97) heliocentric orbit departing Earth with C3 of 148.3 km2 /s2 . The LV upper stage will be used for the TNI. Second is the BPM, a 245 m/s maneuver executed on November 12, 2036, that changes the orbital inclination of the interplanetary trajectory by 0.5° and aligns the transfer plane to intersect Neptune. After an interplanetary trajectory lasting 15.9 years, Odyssey starts its approach to Neptune on May 4, 2049, injecting into elliptical orbit on June 3, 2049.

## **Aerocapture**

The JPL team conducted an extensive review of the available technologies for implementing aerocapture at multiple solar system destinations, from Venus to Neptune. The effort included a detailed examination of the timing sequence for an aerocapture maneuver and an assessment of the potential risks throughout aerocapture execution. The overwhelming conclusion from the review is that NASA is technologically ready to incorporate aerocapture for missions to Titan, Mars, and Venus. The team further concluded that there is no need to complete an aerocapture flight demonstration prior to implementing an aerocapture approach into a flight mission.

**Aerocapture enabled mission** [source](https://academieairespace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Dutta.pdf)

- Reduced propellant need
- Savings used for launch vehicle choice, launch opportunities, or increase on-orbit science payload
- Aerocapture can enable faster interplanetary trajectories – reduce trip time by 3-5 years
- **Fit a larger mission into a smaller funding cap. e.g., Flagship class mission in New Frontiers cap**

**Msg to Danny**

- I read the Decadal report: Neptune wasn't selected at all bc of X
  - Can't be Flagship class, all are full (but new frontiers also delayed by 5 yrs...)
  - What's the added value of visiting Neptune (+ Triton?) now that we are going to Uranus? Need to figure out new value proposition.
- Need aerocapture (which is ready!)
- Trajectory: 3 years longer for -1000 dv
- Focus on ocean worlds??

Yo, I've been looking at the Neptune paper the last few days, doing a lot of research

Idk if you're in the mood (yet) but I'm going to do a little info dump on my findings

I read the 2022 Decadal report. It's not looking good for Neptune:

- Neptune mission (Neptune Odyssey) was not selected for the new Flagship mission. Uranus Orbiter & Probe got first priority (launch target is 2032-ish, our original window), Enceladus Orbilander was second (but won't start development until 2030).
  - Most important reasons were:
    1. Lack of demonstrated viable trajectories to Neptune for a launch within the decade (Uranus has lots of backups without a Jupiter Gravity Assist (JGA). For some reason, all of Odyssey's trajectories bet on SLSB2 being available, even their backups w/o JGA)
    2. Uncertainties in heavy lift launch vehicle accommodation (SLS was required, and it's kinda late. Uranus launches on FH)
    3. The potential need for solar-electric propulsion to reach Neptune if neither the SLS nor a Jupiter gravity assist is available
  - For Neptune Odyssey, they made some **recommendations**:
    "The concept would benefit from a new mission study in which a Jupiter gravity assist is not assumed, and **existing launch vehicles and power systems** are utilized. Such a study will **likely require consideration of the technological feasibility of solar electric propulsion**, identification of any technology developments required, and prioritization of potential science descopes while retaining Flagship-level science."
- Triton Ocean World Surveyor was _recommended_ for New Frontiers 7 (won't be until 2040s most likely).

Given this, I think we need to address some of these issues in our revised proposal. Mainly:

1. The issues that led to selection of other missions over Neptune Odyssey
2. Our timeline is now "taken" by other NASA missions
3. Some of our science questions will be answered by the missions that were selected (Uranus is very similar to Neptune, Enceladus has overlap with Triton). Also, Triton Ocean World Surveyor is going to cover part of our science

I think we need to pivot and answer some questions about our proposal.

1. What class are we targeting? Flagship, New Frontiers, Discovery? This sets our budget
2. What trajectory are we taking and what are our backup options; how flexible can we make it?
3. How are we going to make our mission relevant, now that part of our questions will already be answered? And knowing that Triton Ocean World Surveyor is maybe launching in the 2040s?

My takeaways rn

1. Aerocapture is a very unique part of our proposal; we should really milk/expand it
   - Why is Neptune so suitable for it? (Is it?)
   - How much does it reduce cost and flight time? Investigate
   - Can we do something unique with atmospheric analysis combined with aerocapture?
2. We need to find lots of trajectories:
   - Ones with and without JGA (so unpowered + powered)
     - - Mars, Venus assists - look for possibilities in a wide range
   - We need backup launch dates spanning from 2033 to 2040s
   - Per the Decadal recommendations, we should consider having a section on optional solar electric propulsion, should the launch dates be in the 2040s
3. In our abstract, we only mention an orbiter. So we are in theory free to add something (probe (boring), lander, whatever?) that could set us apart. Something to investigate?
4. Launch vehicles: FH as baseline, do we consider Starship and SLS too?

Let me know your thoughts if you want

## Trajectory

- Low-fidelity broad search
  - Mass vs. TOF plot
  - $C_3$ vs. launch date plot
  - Trajectory plot (radial)
- High-fidelity numerical propagation
  - Departure orbit, phasing?
  - Swingby
  - Neptune (aero)capture
  - Neptune phasing til EOL
- Patched-conic broad search (Uranus orbiter & probe)
- Pykep does not have ephemeris past 2050 :/ -> use tudatpy

The objective of this study was to update the prior UOP study conducted for the 2011 Visions and Voyages Decadal Survey [Iess et al. 2014]. Initial direction included the incorporation of new launch dates corresponding to a project start between 2023 and 2030, as well as refined science goals and payload complement (see also § 1). The study was also directed to increase mission maturity/fidelity where possible, and to develop a chemical-only mission design, thereby removing the solar electric propulsion (SEP) stage that was used in the 2011 UOP concept. The use of radioisotope power systems is assumed. The overall study goal was to mature a comprehensive, but low-cost, technologically-ready Flagship mission.
